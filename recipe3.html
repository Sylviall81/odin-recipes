        <li>
            <p>Heat a large saucepan and dry-fry 2 tsp cumin seeds and a pinch of chilli flakes for 1 min, or until they start to jump around the pan and release their aromas.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Scoop out about half with a spoon and set aside. Add 2 tbsp olive oil, 600g coarsely grated carrots, 140g split red lentils, 1l hot vegetable stock and 125ml milk to the pan and bring to the boil.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Simmer for 15 mins until the lentils have swollen and softened.</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Whizz the soup with a stick blender or in a food processor until smooth (or leave it chunky if you prefer).</p>
        </li>

        <li>
            <p>Season to taste and finish with a dollop of plain yogurt and a sprinkling of the reserved toasted spices. Serve with warmed naan breads.</p>
